# housing_421a
(Re-adding code and maps from old repo)


## Background
The Housing 421A repository contains scripts to gather, analyze and map data related to the 421-a tax abatement program in New York City. There are multiple efforts to replace the program, with a larger focus on consistently providing affordable units for New Yorkers, something the current program has failed at. The data generated here is in support of efforts to highlight many of the 421-a shortcomings.
