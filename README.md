# housing_421a
(Re-adding code and maps from old repo)


## Background
The Housing 421A repository contains scripts to gather, analyze and map data related to the 421-a tax abatement program in New York City. There are multiple efforts to replace the program, with a larger focus on consistently providing affordable units for New Yorkers, something the current program has failed at. The data generated here is in support of efforts to highlight many of the 421-a shortcomings. 


## Data

I use a number of data sources here from various places. I have provided links to them below:
- 421A Properties NYC: https://www1.nyc.gov/site/finance/benefits/benefits-421a.page 
    - Files saved as: 421a_2021_queens.xlsx
    - This page provided by the NYC Dept of Finance has current and historical 421a properties by borough. For all analysis done here, this is the ground truth on 421a properties in NYC. 
- NY State Assembly Districts: https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-data/districts-download-metadata.page 
    - Files saved as: nyad.csv
    - This is the official maps/shapefiles for all NY state district boundaries (Assembly Districts, State Senate, US Congressional)
